# Requirements
The requirements for using Material Plane using the DIY hardware can be divided into 4 parts:

* [Material Plane hardware](#material-plane-hardware)
* [Virtual Tabletop](#virtual-tabletop)
* [Horizontally mounted display](#horizontally-mounted-display)
* [Suitable environment](#suitable-environment)

## Material Plane Hardware
The DIY hardware consists of 2 items:

* [Sensor](BuildInstructions/sensorFull.md)
* One [Bases](BuildInstructions/base.md) for each mini you want to track

You will need to build this hardware yourself (click on the links above for instructions), the requirements for building them is included in the instructions.

Regarding the bases: you will have to determine how many you think you will need. You will want to have at least one for each player character, and maybe some extra for other minis that have to be tracked, such as familiars or important NPCs.<br>
You can track monsters, if you want to, but for most people this is not necessary (since you probably don't want to share the monters' vision with the players) and a lot of people choose to just place the minis on the display without tracking them.

Because the sensor is essentially a camera, you will need to take the distance between the sensor and your display, and the size of the display into account. If the display is too large, the sensor might not be able to see the entire display. Please read the [Display-Sensor Distance](requirements.md#display-sensor-distance) section carefully.

Unless you want to use a projector, you will have to think of a way to mount your display.<br>
The display will have to be mounted horizontally, so you can place minis on top of it. In general, there are 3 approaches to achieve this:

## Laying on a Table
The simplest option would be to simply lay the display on a table. You will probably have to remove the display's foot.<br>
If the back of the display is flat, and the cables can be inserted from the side, this might just work out perfectly without doing anything else.<br>
Otherwise, you could make use of the VESA attachment points (assuming your display has them), and attach a piece of wood to these attachment points to raise the back of the display clear off the table.

## Display Enclosure
A display enclosure is a, generally wooden, enclosure into which a display is mounted.<br>
The advantage of an enclosure is that it look prettier, and offers better protection.<br>
Displays enclosures can be bought, or you could build your own. You can google terms like "RPG TV enclosure" or "RPG TV case" for shops, inspiration or build plans.

## Display Table
The last, and according to many people, ultimate option, is a dedicated display table. This is a table with a built-in display.<br>
These can offer better protection and look better than enclosures. Additionally, your setup is pretty much always ready to go. Many of these tables have built-in accessories, such as dice trays or dice towers, and many have a cover that allow the table to be used as a normal table. However, these tables are generally very expensive, or take a lot of work to build. You can google terms like "RPG TV table" for shops, inspiration or build plans.

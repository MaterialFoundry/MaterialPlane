There are some limitations related to using a touch screen. Below is a summary, for a more detailed hardware comparison, click [here](../hardwareComparison.md).

## IR Touch Frame
* During movement, the mini must always stay in contact (or very close to) the TV, otherwise the touch frame cannot detect it.
* There is a limited amount of touch points, usually 10. This means that you are not able to place more than that number of minis on the TV. For big parties or big battles, this might mean that you can only place minis for the PCs, and not for NPCs.
* Touch points are not completely independent. This means that if you move a mini at one point, it might interfere with the detected location of another mini (this is mostly solved through software).
* Because of the way the touch frame works, one mini can cast a 'shade' over other minis, meaning that the minis in the shade cannot be detected. It is currently not clear how big of an issue this is, and will probably only be relevant if there are a lot of minis close to each other.

## Capacitive Screen
* During movement, the mini must always stay in contact the TV, otherwise the screen cannot detect it.
* There is a limited amount of touch points, usually 10. This does not limit the amount of minis you can have on the TV, but it does limit the amount of minis you can move at the same time. Since it's not common to move that many minis at the same time, this probably isn't a big problem.

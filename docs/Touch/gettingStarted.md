Touch screen support is still experimental. There might be issues with either the module, or due to hardware limitations. Right now I cannot recommend that anyone buys a touch capable screen or IR touch frame for Material Plane, it is probably better to wait until this has been tested more extensively.<br>
<br>
Touch screen functionality is broken in Foundry v11.

Material Foundry allows you to use a touch screen to move physical miniatures and have tokens in Foundry follow this movement.


The table of contents on the left is ordered in a way that you should start from the top and move your way down, but below you will find a short description of the steps you will need to take to get started:

1. [Make sure you know what the requirements are for using Material Plane](requirements.md)
2. [Consider the limitations](limitations.md)
3. [Install and configure the VTT module](Foundry/foundryInstall.md)
4. [Learn how to properly use the module](usage.md)

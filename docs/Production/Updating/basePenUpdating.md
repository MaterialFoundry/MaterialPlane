## Base & Pen
Updating the base and pen is very similar, and is done using Material Companion.<br>
You will need to connect the dock to your computer using the USB port, and connect either a base to the charge slot with the 3 spring terminals, or the pen to its charging slot.<br>
<b>You cannot update the base if the pen is connected to the dock, or vise versa!</b>

1. Open Material Companion and navigate to the 'Base' or 'Pen' sub-tab within the 'Material Plane' tab.
2. At the top, select the correct 'Dock USB Port'. The dock should show up as 'COM## (Dock)'. If it doesn't show up, try refreshing the USB ports. See [here](#finding-the-correct-usb-port) for more info.
3. At the bottom 'Update' section, select the 'Firmware Version' you want to update
6. Optionally, you could tick 'Show Pre-Releases' which will allow you to update a pre-release version (not recommended for normal use)
7. Press the 'Update' button
8. A popup will appear that gives the update progress, you can press 'Details' to get more details about the progress

# Display Selection

There are multiple factors that go into display selection. 

* <b>Size:</b> Bigger isn't always better, see [here](size.md).
* <b>Viewing Angle:</b> One of the most important factor for in-person gaming is the viewing angle, since you and your players will be sitting around the display, viewing it from a large angle. The best thing to do is to go to a local electronics store and take a look at the displays in person. Walk around them and view them from all angles, and see how the image changes and how different TVs perform, especially from up-close.
* <b>Display Type:</b> [Here](type.md) is a comparison between different display types, but it should be noted that there will be a lot of variance between different displays of the same type. For example, on paper, a TN display should not be great for this application due to their bad viewing angles, however, some higher quality TN displays can offer great viewing angles.
* <b>Touch:</b> If you want to use the touch functionality, you'll need a display with built-in touch support, or something like an infrared touch frame. Be sure to read about it [here](../Touch/gettingStarted.md), also read up on the differences between touch and the Material Plane hardware [here](../hardwareComparison.md). It is (currently) not possible to combine touch with the Material Plane hardware. If this ever changes, this will only work for capacitive screens (due to how IR touch frames work).

Also consider how you want to [mount or enclose](mounting.md) and [protect](protection.md) the display.

# Requirements
The requirements for using Material Plane using the production hardware can be divided into 4 parts:

* [Material Plane hardware](#material-plane-hardware)
* [Virtual Tabletop](#virtual-tabletop)
* [Horizontally mounted display](#horizontally-mounted-display)
* [Suitable environment](#suitable-environment)

## Material Plane Hardware
For the production hardware, the most important requirements are the actual hardware.
The following items are required:

* [Sensor](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/sensor)
* [Dock](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/dock)
* One [Base](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/material-plane-base) for each mini you want to track
* [wide-angle lens](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/wide-angle-lens), depending on setup (see [below](#display-sensor-distance))

Various [kits](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/collections/material-plane) are available that contain at least the required components for up to 8 players.

Regarding the bases: you will have to determine how many you think you will need. You will want to have at least one for each player character, and maybe some extra for other minis that have to be tracked, such as familiars or important NPCs.<br>
You can track monsters, if you want to, but for most people this is not necessary (since you probably don't want to share the monters' vision with the players) and a lot of people choose to just place the minis on the display without tracking them.

Because the sensor is essentially a camera, you will need to take the distance between the sensor and your display, and the size of the display into account. If the display is too large, the sensor might not be able to see the entire display. It is possible to install a wide-angle lens into the sensor (or have it pre-installed) to allow you to use bigger displays, or to move the sensor closer to the display. Please read the [Display-Sensor Distance](#display-sensor-distance) section carefully.

Optional hardware:

* [Pen](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/material-plane-pen) to add more interaction options, such as opening doors or panning the map
* [Base adapters](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/base-adapter) to allow the tracking of bigger minis
* [Base](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/base-charging-dock-expansion) or [sensor](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/sensor-charging-dock-expansion) charging dock expansions so you can charge more bases at the same time, or charge the sensor on the dock
* [Square](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/square-magnet) or [Round](https://www.materialfoundry.nl/products/round-magnet) magnets to easily mount minis to bases

# Requirements
The requirements for using Material Plane using the production hardware can be divided into 3 parts:

* [Touch-related hardware](#touch-related-hardware)
* [Virtual Tabletop](#virtual-tabletop)
* [Horizontally mounted display](#horizontally-mounted-display)

# Touch-Related Hardware
If using a infrared touch frame, there are no further requirements besides the display and frame. However, you might find that you need to raise the minis slightly so the touch frame can detect the minis easier. This is especially the case for minis with thin lower sections (around the leg area).

For capacitive touch displays you will need to find some way to have the display detect the mini. The important thing is that there is a conductive path from your hand to the display through the mini. So you could either make conductive bases, use conductive paint, or apply some conductive tape to the bottom of the mini that you have to touch whenever you move the mini.

## WiFi Connection to the VTT
When connecting the sensor to the VTT over WiFi, you have 2 options:

* <b>Direct Connection:</b> The sensor connects directly to the VTT.
* <b>Through Material Companion:</b> The sensor connects to Material Companion, which then connects to the VTT.

The direct connection is preferable, but not always possible. For example, if your Foundry server is secured (using SSL), the Foundry client is not allowed to connect to unsecured external devices.<br>
This is where Material Companion comes into play: it connects to the client from the computer, which is allowed for secured servers. Material Companion can then connect to the sensor and pass all the data through.

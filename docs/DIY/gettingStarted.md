# Getting Started
The Material Plane DIY hardware is one of the hardware options for Material Plane to track minis on a display.<br>
You will have to assembly everything yourself. If you can't or don't want to do this, consider buying the [pre-build production hardware](../Production/gettingStarted.md), which has some other advantages over the DIY hardware. For a full comparison between the various mini-tracking options, please read the [hardware comparison](../hardwareComparison.md) page.

The table of contents on the left is ordered in a way that you should start from the top and move your way down, but below you will find a short description of the most important steps you will need to take to get started:

1. [Make sure you know what the requirements are for using Material Plane](requirements.md)
2. [Figure out what kind of sensor version you want to build](hardwareOverview.md)
3. Build a '[DIY-Full](BuildInstructions/sensorFull.md)' or '[DIY-Basic](BuildInstructions/sensorBasic.md)' sensor
4. [Build one or more bases](BuildInstructions/base.md)
5. [Upload/update the sensor firmware](Updating/sensorUpdating.md)
6. [Figure out the optimal sensor mounting method and position](SensorPositioning/sensorMounting.md)
7. [Connect the sensor to your WiFi network](SensorConfiguration/sensorConnecting.md)
8. [Configure the sensor](SensorConfiguration/sensorSettings.md)
9. [Install and configure the VTT module](Foundry/foundryInstall.md)
10. [Calibrate the sensor](calibration.md)
11. [Learn how to properly use the module](usage.md)

Please check the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) page if you run into any issues.

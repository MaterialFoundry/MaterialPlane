The mount in the included 3D models can be used on either a microphone stand, screwed directly into the ceiling (or other surface), or can be magnetically attached by adding a magnet to the mount.

## Microphone Stand
The mount has 3/8"-16 thread at the bottom to allow the mount to be screwed onto a microphone stand, as shown in the bottom-left image. 3/8" is a standard thread for microphones outside of the US, in the US 5/8"-27 is more common. Adapters to convert 3/8" to 5/8" are easy to find and not very expensive.

When selecting a microphone stand, make sure it can reach high enough, or get a microphone stand extender. You want to take the minimum [sensor-to-display distance](sensorDistance.md) into account.<br>
You could also use wall or ceiling mounted microphone stands.

## Ceiling Mount
A second option is to attach the mount to the ceiling (or other surface). By removing the big bolt, you can take the mount apart, allowing you to fit a screw through the bottom part of the mount, as shown in the bottom-right image.<br>
You can use a countersunk screw with a maximum diameter of 4.5mm/0.177" (US screw size #9 or lower), and a minimum length of 40mm/1.5"

## Magnetic Mount
It is possible to attach a magnet to the bottom of the mount. This allows the sensor to be attached to ferromagnetic objects, such as light fixtures.

The easiest way is to source a suitable magnet is to search for 'rubber coated magnet'. Look for a 20x6mm one (22x6mm can also work, but this is lightly wider than the mount) with M4 internal thread. One with a post (extended thread) will fit, but this is not necessary.<br>
Attach it by removing the big bolt on the mount to take the mount apart. It is then possible to attach the magnet using a M4x22mm countersunk bolt (if the magnet has a post, you can reduce this to M4x16mm).

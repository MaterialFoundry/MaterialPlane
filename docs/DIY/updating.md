# Installing & Updating the Firmware
This page will explain how to install or update the firmware or the sensor.

For the sensor there are 4 ways to update.<br>
The most convenient methods use [Material Companion](https://github.com/materialfoundry/materialcompanion). To use Material Companion, please follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/MaterialFoundry/MaterialCompanion/wiki/Installation).

<b>When the firmware is first installed, it must be installed over the USB port using either Material Companion or the Arduino IDE. WiFi updates are only available if a previous firmware is already installed.</b>
